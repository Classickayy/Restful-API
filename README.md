# Restful-API
My first Restful API

## Project Overview

This project was designed to develop an intuitive API for managing user data. The primary goals included:  
- Implementing GET routes to enable fetching user data based on various criteria, such as user ID, name, and profession.  
- Ensuring the API is efficient, responsive, and capable of handling requests effectively.  
- Gaining hands-on experience in API development while enhancing our programming skills in managing data queries.  

Through this project, we gained valuable insights into server-side programming, working with JSON formatting, and optimizing API performance to handle data requests efficiently.

## Testing Screenshots
